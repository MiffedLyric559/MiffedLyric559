## 🧠 About Me

I break things to understand them and play around with functionality.

I’m exploring cybersecurity from both offensive and defensive angles, with a strong focus on how systems are built, how they fail, and how they can be abused or defended.  
I enjoy digging beneath the surface — understanding *why* something works, not just *how* it is used on the surface.

This profile is a living workspace: labs, notes, experiments, and projects as I learn.

## 🎯 Areas I’m Exploring

- 🔴 Red Team & offensive security fundamentals  
- 🔵 Blue Team concepts & defensive thinking  
- 🧠 Malware analysis & reverse engineering (early-stage)  
- 🌐 Web exploitation & common attack surfaces  
- 🏢 Active Directory & Windows internals  
- 🐧 Linux systems & privilege escalation  
- 🕵️ OSINT & information gathering

## 🔍 How I Learn

- Prefer hands-on labs over theory-only learning  
- Breaking systems to see *why* they break  
- Rebuilding environments to understand authority & flow  
- Testing and playing around with systems, software and infrastructure  

I’m currently between **beginner and intermediate**, focusing on building strong fundamentals instead of rushing into advanced techniques.

## 🧭 Philosophy

- “Understand the system before trying to exploit it.”
- “If it breaks, there’s a reason.”
- “Learning sticks when you struggle a bit.”
